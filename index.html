            <p> We chose this as one of our examples of bad design for a number of reasons but primarily because a lot of the data
            encoded in this chart is misleading. This visualization is intended to reach anybody watching the news and convey
            information about the weather during the current day. It attempts to do so by encoding the weather data in a bar chart,
            using both line marks and spatial regions to encode the temperature and labeled icons to convey the percentage chance of
            rain. For example, the chart is labeled “Hour by Hour Forecast.” However, when you look at the labels on the x-axis, it
            is clear that bars are labeled in two hour increments rather than hour increments. Additionally, there is no y-axis so
            it is not possible to know what attribute the creators of this chart intended to encode with the bar height. However,
            the display suggests that they intended to encode the temperature data with the line mark at the bar height. If this is
            what the intention was, then the graph is very misleading because while the first two bars are labeled with the same
            temperature, they have different heights. Furthermore, the second and third bar are the same height, but different
            temperatures. The last two bars in the chart predict temperatures of 51º and 50º respectively, but the bar showing 50º
            is shorter than the bar showing 51º. Another issue with this chart is that both the bars for the 11 and the 1pm hours
            are not labeled. Similarly, only some of the bars have predictions for oncoming rain. </p>
