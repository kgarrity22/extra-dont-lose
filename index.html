                This original version of this visualization is meant to display the rankings of Major League Baseball teams for each statistic.  Using line and point marks the visualization uses the channel of length for its marks as a way to display these rankings.  The longer the line the higher the team is ranked for that specific stat.  The visualization compares 10 stats for hitting, and 10 stats for pitching, displaying these lines in a circle.  The pitching and hitting stats are separated based on color, with blue being hitting and pink being pitching -- taking use of a color  channel.  While the visualization may be interesting to look at, it is actually ineffective in truly comparing teams.  By looking at the visualization it is hard to compare teams side by side.  Even the teams are sorted alphabetically rather than by winning percentage.

            <p>This original version of this visualization is meant to display how each major league baseball team ranks for specific hitting and pitching statistics.  Using the channel of length for its point/line marks as a way to display these rankings.  The longer the line the higher the team is ranked for that specific stat.  The visualization compares ten statistics for hitting, and ten statistics for pitching, displaying these lines in a circle.  The pitching and hitting statistics are separated based on color, with blue being hitting and pink being pitching -- taking use of a color  channel.  While the visualization may be interesting to look at, it is actually ineffective in truly comparing teams.  By looking at the visualization it is hard to compare teams side by side -- the teams are even sorted alphabetically rather than by winning percentage.  Using this visualization we are not able to get the full picture as to which team is performing best.

                In our new visualization we created a spider graph.  In this graph we created two separate graphs, one for hitting stats and one for pitching stats -- this way we can compare these statistics on their own.  Each corner on the graph represents a different statistic, and we also included a filter which would allow us to select the teams we want to compare.  For our marks we are utilizing points to indicate the rankings for each statistic, and areas to indicate the overall performance of all of the teams (taking into account all of the statistics).  In terms of channel, we use a color channel to encode different teams, and an area channel to show overall performance of a team.
                
                Our new visualization makes it easier to make direct comparisons between teams.  By looking at the area of the graph we can determine which team has the best statistics.  For example in our hitting chart we see that Team 1 has a higher area than Team 2, indicating that Team 1 ranks higher in its statistics and theoretically is the better team.
