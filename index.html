                This original version of this visualization is meant to display the rankings of Major League Baseball teams for each statistic.  Using line and point marks the visualization uses the channel of length for its marks as a way to display these rankings.  The longer the line the higher the team is ranked for that specific stat.  The visualization compares 10 stats for hitting, and 10 stats for pitching, displaying these lines in a circle.  The pitching and hitting stats are separated based on color, with blue being hitting and pink being pitching -- taking use of a color  channel.  While the visualization may be interesting to look at, it is actually ineffective in truly comparing teams.  By looking at the visualization it is hard to compare teams side by side.  Even the teams are sorted alphabetically rather than by winning percentage.
